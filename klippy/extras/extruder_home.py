# Relevant issue: https://gitlab.com/pipettin-bot/pipettin-grbl/-/issues/47#note_1215525244
# Module distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL v3 licence.
#
#
# This class loads the stepper of the active extruder and performs homing on it.
# It is inspired by the manual_stepper module, and it requires a few changes in
# homing.py and toolhead.py to work: https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper/pull/5950
#
# The module requires a modification in "extruder.py", which will create the extruder
# stepper from the PrinterRail class, instead of the PrinterStepper class, when an
# "endstop_pin" is defined in the extruder's config.
#
# A config section is required to activate it, and a command must be sent to use it.
# When activated, some additional parameters must be provided to each [extruder] section.
# For example configuration files, see:
#   config/configs-pipetting-bot/configs-mainsail/printer.cfg
#   config/configs-pipetting-bot/configs-mainsail/home_extruder.cfg

    """
    ! WARNING EXPERIMENTAL
    This class registers a command to home an extruder's stepper.
    This is made possible due to a change in the Extruder class,
    which can now add an endstop to the extruder stepper, if a
    config parameter is provided.

    It relies on a great patch for the HomingMove class at "homing.py",
    and small patches in the ToolHead class at "toolhead.py", which
    enable support for extruder homing/probing. These are mainly:
      - Added logic for calculating the extruder's kin_spos/haltpos/trigpos/etc.
      - Added "set_position_e" to the toolhead.

    A note for achaeologists:
    The "toolhead" object that used to be passed to the 
    PrinterHoming.manual_home method was mostly "virtual".
    Many methods are defined here, but some of them call the
    methods of the actual toolhead. All of these methods are 
    commented out below.

    #     #       method. However it only sets the XYZ components in the XYZ "trapq".

    #     # NOTE: This "set_position" is called three times:
    #     #       -   The first (above) receives "startpos": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0]  (only the E axis really, the rest is left as it was).
    #     #       -   The second receives "movepos": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, -110.0]  (just before overstep correction).
    #     #       -   The third receives "haltpos": [-1.420625, 0.0, 0.0, -110.0]  (after overstep correction).
    #     #       The extruder information is, at the first and second times, in the last element
    #     #       of the list, and is equal to "0" or the output from "get_movepos", respectively.
    #     #       However, the third time the E position is in the first list element, and corresponds
    #     #       to the "corrected" extruder position.
    #     #       This cannot be avoided because "calc_toolhead_pos" (a HomingMove method) receives
    #     #       the output from "calc_position" below, only keeping the first three elements
    #     #       (overwritting the fourth element with the fourth element of get_position).
        
    #     # NOTE: Forcing "0" here means that the corrected "haltpos" is ignored in the "second" call.
    #     # newpos_e = newpos[0]
    #     # newpos_e = newpos[3]
    #     # newpos_e = 0.0
    #     # NOTE: to get the 1st element of the vector after calc_toolhead_pos has run,
    #     #       check if a correction has been calculated below.
    #     if self.corrected_e_pos is None:
    #         # NOTE: use the fourth element by default.
    #         newpos_e = newpos[3]
    #     else:
    #         # NOTE: otherwise, a correction has been made, meaning
    #         #       that we are parsing the output from "calc_toolhead_pos",
    #         #       and the correct "newpos_e" is in the first element.
    #         newpos_e = newpos[0]             # Option 1
    #         #newpos_e = self.corrected_e_pos  # Option 2
        
    #     # NOTE: setup the final new position vector, using th_orig_pos
    #     #       because it is not expected to change during E homing.
    #     pos = self.th_orig_pos[:3] + [newpos_e]

    #     # TODO: I now need to update the "E" queue somehow.
    #     #       When switching extruder steppers, the Extruder class uses the set_position
    #     #       method in its stepper object, passing it: [extruder.last_position, 0., 0.]
    #     #       Thus, I need a three element list, where the first element is the updated position.

    #     # NOTE: The next line from toolhead.py is: "self.flush_step_generation()"
    #     #       Update extruder position, code adapted from "set_position" in toolhead.py.
    #     # NOTE: The "flush_step_generation" toolhead method runs
    #     #       "trapq_finalize_moves" on the extruder's "trapq" as well.
    #     #       No need to do it here, hopefully.
    #     self.set_position2(newpos_e)
        
    #     # NOTE: The next line from toolhead.py is: "self.commanded_pos[:] = newpos".
    #     #       The most similar line from extruder.py is in "sync_to_extruder",
    #     #       from the ExtruderStepper class:
    #     #           self.stepper.set_position([extruder.last_position, 0., 0.])
    #     #self.extruder_stepper.stepper.set_position([newpos_e, 0., 0.])
    #     # NOTE: Since the above line is equivalent to the next line , I've commented it.
    #     #       Furthermore, "commanded_pos" *will* be updated in the toolhead by the
    #     #       last line below, calling "toolhead.set_position".

    #     # NOTE: The next line from toolhead.py is: "self.kin.set_position(newpos, homing_axes)"
    #     #       It calls "rail.set_position" on all toolhead's rails (which are PrinterRails),
    #     #       and updates the toolhead limits using "rail.get_range".
    #     #       Those rails are "PrinterRail" classes, which in turn call
    #     #       "stepper.set_position" on each of their steppers.
    #     #       It calls "itersolve_set_position". Replicate here:
    #     self.rail.set_position([newpos_e, 0., 0.])
    #     # NOTE: note that this position will be then read by the 
    #     #       call to "stepper.get_commanded_position" in "homing.py".

    #     # NOTE: The next line in toolhead.py is: self.printer.send_event("toolhead:set_position")
    #     #       It runs the "reset_last_position" method in GCodeMove at "gcode_move.py",
    #     #       which takes no arguments. It runs the "position_with_transform" method,
    #     #       which is apparently "toolhead.get_position" (simply returning "commanded_pos").
    #     # NOTE: Thus, I can simply call "set_position" from the toolhead, that does all of the above.
    #     #       This is expected for a complete regular homing move, guessing it shouldn't hurt.
